Using a Windows 10 virtual machine as a target for practicing attacks offers several key benefits:

Real-World Relevance: Windows is the most dominant desktop operating system globally.
Practicing on a Windows 10 VM provides a realistic environment to learn how to exploit vulnerabilities and misconfigurations commonly found in corporate and personal settings.

Safe and Isolated Environment: Virtualization allows you to create a sandboxed environment.
You can attack the Windows 10 VM without any risk to your primary operating system or network.

Replicable and Customizable Setups: You can easily create multiple copies (clones) of your Windows 10 VM.
This allows you to test different attack vectors on identical systems.

Learning Modern Attack and Defense Techniques: It provides a platform to understand and practice attacks against modern operating system features,
such as Active Directory (in a domain-joined setup), user account control (UAC), and Windows Defender. 

Convenience and Flexibility: You can easily start, stop, and reset your target environment.
This flexibility is crucial for repetitive testing and for quickly setting up different lab scenarios without the time-consuming process of reinstalling an operating system on a physical machine.

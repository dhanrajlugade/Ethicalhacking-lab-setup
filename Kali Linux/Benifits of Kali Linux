Using Kali Linux as a virtual machine (VM) is the standard and most recommended method for practicing ethical hacking. 
This approach provides a powerful, controlled, and efficient environment with numerous benefits for both beginners and seasoned security professionals.

Massive Pre-installed Toolset:
Kali Linux is a purpose-built distribution for cybersecurity.
It comes with over 600 pre-installed penetration testing tools, including stalwarts like Metasploit Framework, Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite, and Aircrack-ng.

Safe and Isolated Environment:
Running Kali Linux in a VM creates a "sandbox"â€”an isolated space that separates the hacking activities from your main operating system (the host).

Portability and Flexibility:
A Kali Linux VM is a self-contained file (or set of files) that can be easily moved, copied, and shared.
Work from Anywhere: You can store your Kali VM on an external hard drive and run it on any computer that has virtualization software installed.
Easy Replication: You can quickly clone your configured Kali VM to create multiple attacker machines for different scenarios or to share your setup with others.

Cost-Effective:
Kali Linux is free and open-source, and leading virtualization software like VirtualBox is also free.
This means you can build a professional-grade ethical hacking lab with powerful capabilities for no software cost
